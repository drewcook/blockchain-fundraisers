				This decentralized application is a space for creating fundraisers and making donations to
				them, all on the Ethereum blockchain. You should already have a wallet connected to this
				site, and therefore, you will be able to participate in both creating and donating to
				fundraisers.

			<Typography gutterBottom>
				As a creator of a fundraiser, you will be able to manage the funds of that fundraiser. Other
				users can make donations in the form of Ether to your fund, and you will act as a custodian
				for these funds. You may withdraw the funds out to be donated directly into a beneficiary
				account. All of this is handled via smart contracts deployed on the Ethereum Rinkeby
				testnet. <strong>Ensure your wallet is connected and on the Rinkeby testnet.</strong>

				Check out some of the causes created by other users on the <strong>Explore</strong> page, or
				set up a new fundraiser by clicking the <strong>Create</strong> link.
